What are the tradeoffs to consider when deciding to poll or use interrupts to accept input?
ANS: Polling is immediate and repeated checks for a condition. Interrupts can take place at any time and don't need to be checked repeatedly.

Which pins on the Arduino Mega are able to be used for interrupts?
ANS: Pins 2, 3, 21, 20, 19, 18

Which port and pin number on the AVR ATMEGA2560 do each pin number on the Arduino Mega from Q2 correspond to? 
For example, the documentation (linked in slides), states that Digital Pin 0 on the Arduino corresponds to Port E Pin 0 (PE0) on the AVR.
ANS:Port E Pin 4 (PE4), Port E Pin 5 (PE5), Port D Pin 2 (PD2), Port D Pin 3 (PD3), Port D Pin 4 (PD4), Port D Pin 5 (PD5)

Describe the four ways an external interrupt can be triggered using the Arduino libraries.
ANS: Low, interrupt is triggered when the voltage on the interrupt pin falls to LOW. This is activated when the LOW parameter is attached to the interrupt.
     Change,  interrupt is triggered when the voltage on the interrupt pin changes from LOW to HIGH or vice versa. This is activated when the CHANGE parameter is attached to the interrupt.
     Rising, similar to CHANGE, the interrupt is triggered when the voltage on the interrupt pin changes only from LOW to HIGH. This is activated when the RISING parameter is attached to the interrupt.
     Falling, opposite of RISING, the interrupt is triggered when the voltage on the interrupt pin changes only from HIGH to LOW. This is activated when the FALLING parameter is attached to the interrupt.
